Were I ended Today

-Seperated things out of pipeline.c. t.ex shader compilation, hot reloading, file watcher and file read etc.


What I want to do next time

-Continue working on the hot reloading till I get a working API, then even if the internal stuff is not ready, I can do that a later date.

After that might be time to start working on my actual frame, run a compute, copy image to swapchain, present image. That will open up Raytracing on Compute tasks for me. Also later do a .dot loader for voxels
